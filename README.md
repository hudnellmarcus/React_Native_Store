# React_Native_Store

My quick attempt at a full-stack bookstore application! 

# Notes

- The backend is mostly for reference, as the front-end in React-Native utilizes a JSON file with hard coded data.
- I did not connect the API as the initial project mentioned it was okay to use mock data.

# To Run The Backend 

- Make sure to install any dependencies with `npm install` in the terminal.
- You can start the local server as well the connection to the MongoDB database with `npm run start:dev`

# To Run The Bookstore

- Make sure to install any dependencies with `npm install` in the terminal.
- The application will run with expo Go or any simulators by running `npx expo start` in the terminal.


# Known Bugs

- Decreasing quantity in cart will remove item completely no matter the quantity.

# Improvements to be made 

- General UI improvements!!
